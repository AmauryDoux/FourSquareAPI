Welcome to My Foursquare API consuming app!

To get started with this app, all you need to do is to open a terminal window and run this command:

  $ node server.js

This will run the nodeJs server so that you can view the app at this address on your favorite browser

  http://127.0.0.1:8080

That's all!
Enjoy!
